## Introduction
Python is a general-purpose, object orientated programming language used by popular websites like YouTube and Dropbox. 

**NOTE:** Before students embark on these lessons they should have an idea about **files** and **directories** including the **working directory** and how to **start a Python interpreter**.  

<h3>Lesson One: The Basics of Python</h3>

**Variables:**

To create such websites, programmers need to be able to store and manipulate data, and they do so using variables. 

*Definition:* **Variables** are the names associated with a pieces of stored data. 

You can assign variables to values like so: 

``` 
Test_score = 100
```

**Assignment & Comparative Statements:**

To assign variables to values you use a single equals sign like so:

However, to compare to check if lines of code are the same you use a double equals sign like so: SCREENSHOT. 

<h3>Lesson Two: Data Types & Structures</h3> 

Programmers often have to deal with lots of data, and this data comes in various different types. 

*Definition:* **Integers** are basically whole numbers. ```e.g. 5 ```

*Definition:* **Real numbers/ floating point** are numbers containing decimals. ```e.g. 1.2 ```

 *Definition:* **Booleans** are used so programmers can represent whether a statement is TRUE or FALSE. 
 
*Definition:* **Strings** are a list of characters which can be alphanumeric.

**Comments:**

These are lines of text that don't run as part of the program. They are only there to make the code easier to understand They appear at the start of the body of your program like so :

**Arithmetic Operators:**

You can use different operators to perform different calculations on your code. There are five main types of arithemtic operators which are most commonly used in Python, these are: 

-, +, *, /, %
CANT INCLUDE DOUBLE ASTERISK

**Relational Operators:** 

Similarly, relational operators act as conditions to check statements/variables. Below is a table of relational operators:

Symbols | What They do 
--------|-------------
= or == | Determines whether two values are equal
<> or != | Determines whether two values are unequal 
< | Determines whether one value is less than another (vice versa for >)
<= | Determines whether one value is less than or equal to another (vice versa for >=)

**Boolean Operators:** 

Conditions in the program help the programmer to make use of the operators AND, NOT and OR to construct expressions. The definitions of these operators are given below: 

X | NOT X 
--|-------
FALSE | TRUE 
TRUE | FALSE 

X | Y | X AND Y 
--|---|--------
FALSE | FALSE | FALSE 
FALSE| TRUE | FALSE 
TRUE | FALSE | FALSE
TRUE | TRUE | TRUE 

X | Y | X OR Y 
--|---|-------
FALSE | FALSE | FALSE
FALSE | TRUE | TRUE 
TRUE | FALSE | TRUE 
TRUE | TRUE | TRUE 

**The Precedence of Standard Operators:**

As in Mathematics, some operators take precedence over others. To figure out which ones are more important simply use the **BODMAS** rule. 

<h3>Lesson Three: String Manipulation</h3>
**Slicing and Concatonation:** 

Python, like other languages has different sets of functions which caan be used to operate on strings. They can be used to conduct various different tasks like to copy, compare or determine the length of a string. Other functions include extracting different parts of strings, working out where a particular phrase appears in a string and converting characters into their ASCII codes and vice versa.

<h3> Lesson Four: The Structure of Procedural Programs</h3> 
**Functions:** 

*Definition:* A function is an easy way of re-executing large pieces of code. You start by defining the function using **def**, followed by a list of **parameter names**.

**Constructs:** 
Programs make use of constructs to make code more efficient and effective. The three basic types of programming constructs used to control execution are **Sequence, Selection & Iteration**.  

*Definition:* **Sequence** is when the instructions are executed in the order in which they appear.

*Definition:* **Iteration** basically means repeating instructions for a set number of times or until a condition is met. 

There are two basic types of Iteration: 

These are **count** and **condition controlled loops**.

There is one type of **count controlled loop** called the **FOR loop**. This loop enables instructions to be repeated for a set number of times. 

There are also two types of **condition controlled loops**, These are the **REPEAT** and **WHILE loops**. 

WHILE loops test the condition at the start of the code and the instrctions following aren't executed unless the condition is met. As a result, it could be that no instrctions are executed 

REPEAT loops check the condition at the end of the code so the instructions inside the loop will be repeated at least once. 

SCREENSHOT EXAMPLES

*Definition:* **Selection** is used when instructions are executed depending upon some condiion. Examples of this include **IF** and **SELECT CASE** statements. As a result, some instructions may not be executed.
